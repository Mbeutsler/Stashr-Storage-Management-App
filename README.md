## <a name="quick-start">🤸 Quick Start</a>

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JavaScript-Mastery-Pro/storage_management_solution.git
cd storage_management_solution
```

**Installation**

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT="https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_USERS_COLLECTION=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_FILES_COLLECTION=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_BUCKET=""
NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY=""
```

Replace the values with your actual Appwrite credentials. You can obtain these credentials by signing up &
creating a new project on the [Appwrite website](https://appwrite.io/).

**Running the Project**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.

**Currently there are a few parts that can be fixed at later date**

There are a few implementations that might be fixed later on but I need to move on from this project. I spent more time than thought on trying this whole new system with appwrite, a new experience for me overall.

👉 **Delete Files Global**: For shared files across multiple accounts, the delete file function will delete the file from all users not just on one account.

👉 **Shared Files**: Made it so only the owner can remove shared users. However, I want to implement either not showing the x button for non-owners or a message pop up that says only owner can remove shared users. Non-functional <Toaster /> used in ActionDropdown.tsx.
